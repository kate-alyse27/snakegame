# snakegame
This game is a replica of the popular game, Snake where the user commands the direction of a snake that grows as it eats pieces of food. The game ends when the user
lets the head of the snake run into itself or move off of the bounds of the game board. 

I made this game as the final project to my first introductory Python course.
